                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Alec. I'm from a town called O'Fallon in Southern Illinois (about 20mins away from the river). I'll be using this site
                    to detail a highlights from my painting career and some photos of my growth over time. Everything from my first piece to the current
                    commision work I do now, and everything inbetween. My hobby is a bit different from traditional canvas painting, I do minature painting.
                    They are fundamentally the same, but differ in the 2D vs. 3D aspect. So, I'll start from the beginning.</p>

                <h2>Where the Magic is Made</h2>
                <p>Before I get into any of the actual models, I figured a picture of my workstation would be good for some context. It's what I would describe
                    as an organized mess. It's nothing fancy, but it serves its purpose, somewhat. Complete with an unpainted models to shame me into work.

                <h2>From Small Beginnings</h2>
                <p>Below is the first model I ever painted, about 8 years ago. As you can see, it's pretty awful. The paint is thick, the model is dirty and
                    the basing is rough. I could go and on, but that would serve no point. I keep this model around to show me where I came from, to remind
                    me of my improvement over the years. Hopefully you find the other images on this page at least a bit more visually appeasing.

                <h2>First Finished Project</h2>
                <p>After spending about 2 years on my last army (and many more models that look like the one above), I started on my Ultramrines army
                    for Warhammer 40k. This will be the first project I consider to be at least decent and worth showing. The title is in fact a little misleading,
                    as I still add to the army occasionaly. Pictured below is everything I have finished up to date.

                <h2>Current Work</h2>
                <p>There has been plenty of work done inbetween my Ultramarines and this project, but as this is my most recent, I figured it would be a good
                    landmark of my current skill. Recently <strong>Games Workshop</strong> re-released the rules and minature line to the <em>Lord of the Rings</em>
                    tabletop game. Being a big Tolkien fan, I of course had to drop everything I was doing and shift my focus.

                <h2>Commision Work</h2>
                <p>About a year ago, I realized that I could make a little bit of money while also improving my skills and practicing my hobby. So I took on a couple
                    of jobs from a couple of people I knew personally. I recently am wrapping up a commision for a force of rebels for <strong>Fantasy Flight's</strong>
                    <em>Star Wars Legion</em> as well as a friend's D&D party.
